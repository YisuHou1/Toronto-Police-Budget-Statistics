To extract data for multiple years (2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024) from Open Data Toronto, you will need to first check whether these datasets are available and, if so, which resource contains the data for each year. Here’s how you can modify your code to find and load resources for multiple years if they exist:

First, inspect all available resources to see if datasets for the additional years are listed.
Once identified, you can filter or loop through the resources that correspond to the years you need.
Here's an updated approach that might help:

r
复制代码
library(opendatatoronto)
library(tidyverse)

# Get package details
package_bud <- show_package("668434ee-9541-40a8-adb6-0ad805fcc9b6")

# Get all resources for this package
resources_bud <- list_package_resources("668434ee-9541-40a8-adb6-0ad805fcc9b6")

# Identify datastore resources for CSV and GeoJSON
datastore_resources_bud <- 
  filter(resources_bud, tolower(format) %in% c('csv', 'geojson'))

# Inspect the resource titles and names to find the ones for each year
print(datastore_resources_bud$resource)

# Load all resources that match the required years
years_to_extract <- c("2021", "2022", "2023", "2024")

# Extract and combine data from the available resources for the specified years
data_bud_combined <- datastore_resources_bud %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, paste(years_to_extract, collapse = "|"))) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  do(get_resource(.$id))

# Combine all years' data into one dataframe
final_data_bud <- bind_rows(data_bud_combined)
Explanation:

The script now searches for resources that contain the target years in their names. It uses str_detect to look for specific years (2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024).
Once the resources are identified, it loops through them, loading each one and combining them into a single dataset using bind_rows().
If you don't see resources for certain years, it could be because they have not been published yet, or they may be under a different package or resource ID. You can check the metadata of each resource for more details.

ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
The error you're encountering, Error in match.names(clabs, names(xi)) : names do not match previous names, occurs because rbind() expects all data frames to have the same column names. If the column names in data_bud0, data_bud1, etc., differ, rbind() will throw an error.

Here are a few approaches to handle this:

1. Ensure Column Names Match:
Before combining the datasets, ensure that all column names match. You can standardize the column names using dplyr::rename() or handle the differences explicitly.

Here’s an updated code with checks for column name consistency:

r
复制代码
library(opendatatoronto)
library(tidyverse)

# Load each dataset
data_bud0 <- filter(datastore_resources_bud, row_number() == 1) %>% get_resource()
data_bud1 <- filter(datastore_resources_bud, row_number() == 2) %>% get_resource()
data_bud2 <- filter(datastore_resources_bud, row_number() == 3) %>% get_resource()
data_bud3 <- filter(datastore_resources_bud, row_number() == 4) %>% get_resource()
data_bud4 <- filter(datastore_resources_bud, row_number() == 5) %>% get_resource()

# Standardize column names to match
all_data_list <- list(data_bud0, data_bud1, data_bud2, data_bud3, data_bud4)

# Identify the set of column names shared by all datasets
common_cols <- Reduce(intersect, lapply(all_data_list, colnames))

# Filter each dataset to include only the common columns
standardized_data <- lapply(all_data_list, function(df) {
  df %>% select(all_of(common_cols))
})

# Combine the standardized datasets
raw_budget_data <- bind_rows(standardized_data)
Explanation:
common_cols: This identifies the columns that are common across all datasets.
lapply and select: Each dataset is filtered to only include the common columns.
bind_rows: Combines the datasets row-wise into a single data frame.
2. Handling Missing Columns:
If you want to allow for missing columns and fill them with NA for datasets that do not have certain columns, you can use bind_rows() from dplyr, which automatically handles mismatched columns:

r
复制代码
# Combine the datasets, filling in missing columns with NA where necessary
raw_budget_data <- bind_rows(data_bud0, data_bud1, data_bud2, data_bud3, data_bud4)
This approach ensures that even if the column names do not match exactly, bind_rows() will create NA values in place of missing columns.

Let me know if either of these approaches resolves your issue!

for a data frame in R, how do I calculate the value of a variable in one row minus the value of the same variable in the row above
ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
To calculate the value of a variable in one row minus the value of the same variable in the row above in R, you can use the lag() function from the dplyr package. This function shifts the values in a column by a specified number of rows (typically by 1 to compare with the previous row).

Here's an example of how to do this:

r
复制代码
library(dplyr)

# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  value = c(10, 15, 20, 18, 25)
)

# Calculate the difference between the current row and the previous row
df <- df %>%
  mutate(diff_value = value - lag(value))

# View the result
print(df)
Explanation:
lag(value): This gets the value of the value column from the previous row.
value - lag(value): This subtracts the value of the current row from the previous row.
The resulting diff_value column will contain NA in the first row (since there is no previous row), and the differences for subsequent rows.

Example Output:
bash
复制代码
  id value diff_value
1  1    10         NA
2  2    15          5
3  3    20          5
4  4    18         -2
5  5    25          7

  )
) here, I want Percent_Change to only have 2 decimal places
ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
To limit the Percent_Change to 2 decimal places, you can use the round() function within the mutate() function in your dplyr code. Here’s how you can modify your code:

r
复制代码
summary_table <- summary_table %>%
  mutate(
    Change_From_Last = case_when(
      Year == 2020 ~ NA,
      TRUE ~ Yearly_Budget - lag(Yearly_Budget)
    ),
    
    Percent_Change = case_when(
      Year == 2020 ~ NA,
      TRUE ~ round(100 * ((Yearly_Budget - lag(Yearly_Budget)) / lag(Yearly_Budget)), 2)
    )
  )
Explanation:
round(x, 2): This rounds x to 2 decimal places. It is applied to the result of the percentage calculation.
This will ensure that the Percent_Change column shows values rounded to two decimal places.

您说：
it works, now pls make the summary table into a table using knitr and kableextra
ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
You can use the knitr package along with the kableExtra package to display your summary_table in a well-formatted table. Here’s how you can do it:

r
复制代码
# Load the necessary libraries
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Create a nicely formatted table using kable and kableExtra
summary_table %>%
  kable("html", col.names = c("Year", "Yearly Budget", "Change From Last", "Percent Change")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
Explanation:
kable("html"): This generates the table in HTML format, which is often used for better styling in environments like RMarkdown or notebooks.
col.names: This allows you to specify column names for the table.
kable_styling(): This adds Bootstrap styling options such as striped rows, hover effects, and making the table responsive for different screen sizes.
This will render a clean and responsive table with your summary data.

Run rlang::last_trace() to see where the error occurred. what's the problem here
ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
The error you're encountering is due to the fact that geom_histogram() is designed to create a histogram, which requires only one aesthetic (x or y). It automatically bins the values along one axis, which should typically be a continuous variable.

In your case, you're trying to plot a time series (police budget over time), which would be better represented with a line plot or bar plot, not a histogram. Here's how you can fix it:

For a bar plot:
If you want to show the police budget for each year as bars, use geom_bar(stat = "identity"):

r
复制代码
ggplot(data = summary_table_bud, aes(x = Year, y = Yearly_Budget)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") + 
  labs(
    title = "Figure 1: Total Police Budget Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Yearly Budget ($)"
  )
For a line plot:
If you want to show the trend of the police budget over time, use geom_line():

r
复制代码
ggplot(data = summary_table_bud, aes(x = Year, y = Yearly_Budget)) + 
  geom_line(color = "skyblue") + 
  geom_point(color = "darkblue", size = 3) + # Optional, to add points to the line
  labs(
    title = "Figure 1: Total Police Budget Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Yearly Budget ($)"
  )
Explanation:
geom_bar(stat = "identity"): This creates a bar plot where the height of each bar corresponds to the y value, which in this case is the Yearly_Budget. The stat = "identity" ensures that the actual values of Yearly_Budget are used rather than counts.
geom_line(): This creates a line plot connecting the yearly budget over time.
geom_point(): Optionally adds points to highlight the specific yearly data on the line plot.
Try these alternatives, and they should work for visualizing your budget data over time!

I have a data frame with year, crime count, and cleared crime count. I want to make a graph that looks like the one I attached, with year as the x axis, crimes as the y axis, crime count and cleared crime count filled in 2 different colors.
ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
To create a stacked bar plot similar to the image you provided, you can use ggplot2 in R, where the x-axis is the year, the y-axis is the crime count, and the two different categories are Crime Count and Cleared Crime Count. Here’s how you can structure the code:

Example Code:
Assuming your data frame has columns Year, Crime_Count, and Cleared_Crime_Count, you will need to reshape your data to a "long" format using pivot_longer() from tidyr to plot the stacked bars. Here's how:

r
复制代码
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Sample data frame (replace this with your actual data)
df <- data.frame(
  Year = c(2020, 2021, 2022, 2023),
  Crime_Count = c(100, 150, 130, 160),
  Cleared_Crime_Count = c(50, 70, 65, 80)
)

# Reshape data to long format
df_long <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Crime_Count, Cleared_Crime_Count),
               names_to = "Crime_Type",
               values_to = "Count")

# Create the stacked bar plot
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Count, fill = Crime_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("skyblue", "tomato")) +  # Custom colors
  labs(
    title = "Crime and Cleared Crime Count Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Crimes",
    fill = "Crime Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation:
pivot_longer(): Converts the data from a wide format (where Crime_Count and Cleared_Crime_Count are separate columns) into a long format that ggplot2 can use to stack bars.
geom_bar(stat = "identity"): Creates the stacked bar chart.
scale_fill_manual(): Specifies custom colors for the Crime_Count and Cleared_Crime_Count.
theme_minimal(): Applies a clean theme to the plot.
Customizing Colors:
You can adjust the color scheme by modifying scale_fill_manual(). For example:

r
复制代码
scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "firebrick"))
This code should give you a plot that looks like the one in the image, with Year on the x-axis and the number of crimes on the y-axis, with two categories (crime count and cleared crime count) stacked for each year. Let me know if you need further customization!






您说：
your example code works for the most part, but it adds the cleared crimes on top of the total crimes. I want it to be total crimes on the top and cleared crimes as a proportion of total crimes, since cleared crimes always < total crimes.
ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
To achieve what you're aiming for, where the cleared crimes are represented as a proportion of the total crimes, you need to stack the bars such that the total crimes are on top, but the cleared crimes are represented as part of the total.

Here's an approach:

Keep Crime_Count as the total crimes.
Instead of stacking cleared crimes on top, plot it as part of the total, but only up to the value of Cleared_Crime_Count.
We can do this by plotting total crimes first, then overlaying cleared crimes in a way that reflects it being a portion of the total.

Updated Code:
r
复制代码
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Sample data frame (replace this with your actual data)
df <- data.frame(
  Year = c(2020, 2021, 2022, 2023),
  Crime_Count = c(100, 150, 130, 160),
  Cleared_Crime_Count = c(50, 70, 65, 80)
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(Year))) + 
  # Plot total crime count as a full bar
  geom_bar(aes(y = Crime_Count, fill = "Total Crimes"), stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  
  # Overlay cleared crimes as a portion of the total crimes
  geom_bar(aes(y = Cleared_Crime_Count, fill = "Cleared Crimes"), stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  
  # Custom colors
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Total Crimes" = "skyblue", "Cleared Crimes" = "tomato")) +
  
  # Labels and theme
  labs(
    title = "Crime and Cleared Crime Count Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Crimes",
    fill = "Crime Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation:
Total Crimes are plotted first as the full bar for each year.
Cleared Crimes are plotted as part of the total crime count for each year.
position = "stack" ensures that the two values are stacked, but since cleared crimes are less than total crimes, they are "nested" within the total crimes.
Visualization:
The top bar will represent total crimes (Crime_Count).
The portion filled in a different color will represent cleared crimes (Cleared_Crime_Count), which will always be less than the total crimes.
This will give you a visual representation of the total crime count and, within it, the cleared crime count as a proportion. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!


### Conversation about editing the paper ###

Abstract: An analysis of Toronto's annual police budget and crime counts
was conducted using R to determine the effectiveness of the budget in preventing
crime within the city from 2020 to 2023. It was found that the number of
reported crimes steadily increased while the rate of cleared crimes decreased
over time. Changes in the police budget, including raises from 2020 to 2022
and a reduction from 2022 to 2023, were uninfluential toward crime rates. The
finding that the police budget does not have positive or negative relationships
with crime is potentially an indication that Toronto's current mode of crime 
prevention is unproductive, and the police budget is potentially being wasted. 
It calls for a need to reconsider how the safety of Toronto's citizens should
be facilitated. (Please edit this abstract, mainly focusing on 3 things: typos, clarity, removing unnecessary filler words/phrases)

Abstract

This study analyzed Toronto's annual police budget and crime statistics from 2020 to 2023 using R to assess the budget's effectiveness in preventing crime. Results showed that reported crimes steadily increased while the clearance rate declined over time. Budget changes, including increases from 2020 to 2022 and a reduction from 2022 to 2023, had no significant impact on crime rates. The lack of a relationship between the police budget and crime suggests that Toronto's current crime prevention strategies may be ineffective and that the police budget could be misallocated. These findings highlight the need to reevaluate strategies for ensuring the safety of Toronto's citizens.

Introduction

In recent years, personal safety has become a prominent concern among Toronto's citizens. @socialconnectedness illustrated a rise in violent crimes; the annual number of shootings in 2020 was 462, nearly double the average annual number from 2004 to 2015. The findings of @Putrik2019 establish a connection between violence and the lack of subjective safety, showing that people's perception of higher rates of violent crimes, among other crimes, was the only factor positively correlated with feeling unsafe. The objective increase in violent crimes and subjective safety concerns compel individuals to question whether the city's police department is fulfilling its purpose, especially since the police consume a significant proportion of the city budget.

To date, no comprehensive study has addressed the relationship between the police budget and the number of crimes in Toronto. Such an analysis is essential to assess the effectiveness of the police department in preventing crime and protecting citizens' safety. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature. In the United States, a few quantitative studies have examined this topic, with most scholars identifying a significantly negative relationship between police budget and crime rates @MELLO @LIN.

Using official data from Open Data Toronto @opendatatoronto and the R programming language @r, the annual police budget, the number of reported crimes, and the number of cleared crimes were analyzed for the years 2020 to 2023. The data revealed that the number of crimes consistently rose while the number of cleared crimes remained relatively stable, leading to a reduction in the clearance ratio. The police department's total annual budget, calculated by subtracting revenues from expenditures, increased slightly from 2020 to 2022 but fell by over 40% in 2023.

Please do the same for the next section: ## Introduction of Datasets
Two separate datasets were extracted from Open Data Toronto @opendatatoronto, 
one recording all instances of expenditure and revenue since 2020, the other storing
the number of reported crimes in different categories and the corresponding
number of cleared crimes until the end of 2023. The summary statistics of the 
disaggregated data are displayed in @tbl-raw-bud and @tbl-raw-cri in the Appendix. They are not included in the body of
this paper because they are not used for analysis; the paper emphasizes aggregate
budgets and reported crime counts instead of individual paychecks and crime
categories. 

Open Data Toronto was selected to be the data source because it provides official
data from the City of Toronto, ensuring a decent level of credibility, variety,
and depth. The only alternative source of datasets on crime and police budget is 
the data portal of Toronto Police, and the datasets are identical to those in
Open Data Toronto. 

The measurements of the data, as provided by @opendatatoronto,
are not perfectly reliable. The police budget dataset is measured by addressing
approved budgets from Toronto Police Services Board and City Council and operation
expenses incurred. Expenses or revenues that were not officially reported were
excluded from the dataset. The dataset for crime reports and cleared crimes
relies on reports filed by officers, so undiscovered crimes are not
included, and unfounded reports are included. The biases in the measurements
increases the difficulty when interpreting trends. For example, if the number
of reported crimes increased over time, it might be due to an actual increase
in the number of crimes or an improvement in officers' ability to find crimes.

The cleaned, aggregated datasets are as follows: [tables here]
## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning and calculations were used to arrive at the variables in @tbl-bud
and @tbl-cri. "Year" was limited to 2020-2023 because the oldest data in the 
police budget dataset is 2020, and the most recent data in the crime report
dataset is 2023. "Yearly Budget" was calculated by summing all individual
expenses and revenues in the disaggregated dataset, which stores positive values for 
expenses and negative values for revenues. "Change From Last" was acquired by
subtracting the previous year's "Yearly Budget" from the current year, except
2020 because the previous year does not exist. "Percent Change" was calculated
by dividing the prevous year's "Yearly budget" by the current "Change From Last".
For @tbl-cri, "Yearly Crimes" and "Cleared Crimes" were calculated by summing
the reported cases and cleared cases of all crime categories in the disaggregated
dataset, respectively. The data cleaning proecss was aided by the R package
tidyverse @tidyverse.

Introduction of Datasets
Two datasets were extracted from Open Data Toronto @opendatatoronto: one records all instances of expenditure and revenue since 2020, and the other contains the number of reported crimes in various categories along with the corresponding number of cleared crimes up to the end of 2023. Summary statistics of the disaggregated data are presented in @tbl-raw-bud and @tbl-raw-cri in the Appendix. These tables are excluded from the main body because the analysis focuses on aggregate budgets and total crime counts rather than individual expenses and specific crime categories.

Open Data Toronto was chosen as the data source because it provides official data from the City of Toronto, ensuring credibility, variety, and depth. The only alternative source for crime and police budget data is the Toronto Police data portal, and its datasets are identical to those in Open Data Toronto.

The data measurements from @opendatatoronto are not entirely reliable. The police budget dataset includes approved budgets from the Toronto Police Services Board and City Council, as well as operational expenses incurred. Expenses or revenues that were not officially reported are excluded from the dataset. The crime reports and cleared crimes dataset relies on reports filed by officers, meaning undiscovered crimes are not included, and unfounded reports are counted. These measurement biases complicate trend interpretation. For example, an increase in reported crimes may reflect either an actual rise in crime or an improvement in officers' ability to detect crimes.

The cleaned, aggregated datasets are as follows: [tables here]

Data Cleaning
Data cleaning and calculations were performed to derive the variables in @tbl-bud and @tbl-cri. The "Year" variable was limited to 2020–2023 because the police budget dataset begins in 2020 and the crime report dataset extends to 2023. "Yearly Budget" was calculated by summing all individual expenses and revenues in the disaggregated dataset, with expenses represented as positive values and revenues as negative values. "Change From Last" was determined by subtracting the previous year's "Yearly Budget" from the current year, excluding 2020, which has no preceding year. "Percent Change" was calculated by dividing the previous year's "Yearly Budget" by the current "Change From Last." For @tbl-cri, "Yearly Crimes" and "Cleared Crimes" were calculated by summing the reported and cleared cases across all crime categories, respectively. The data cleaning process was facilitated by the R package tidyverse @tidyverse.

repeat for the next section: @tbl-bud and @fig-bud shows minor increases in the police budget from 2020 to 2022, 
and a near-half reduction in 2023. @fig-cri illustrates consistent increases in
total crimes from 2021 to 2023, while the cleared cases remained relatively
static throughout four years. Thus, it is unsurprising to observe that in
@tbl-cri, the rate of cleared crimes decreased steadily, demonstrating the
persistent deterioration of the safety conditions in Toronto, regardless of
police budget. 

It is acknowledged that the recorded total budget in 2023 might not represent the real level of policing resources comparative to earlier years. While 2024 data is not presented in this paper, its recorded total budget is around 1.2 billion, similar to the 2023 budget, but earlier years all had more than 2 billion dollars. This indicates that a shift in measuring or recording methods had likely occurred in 2023, although @opendatatoronto does not state such a change. This is a key limitation of the data that may make the analysis of this paper invalid.

Analysis of Police Budget and Crime Trends

@tbl-bud and @fig-bud show minor increases in the police budget from 2020 to 2022, followed by a nearly 50% reduction in 2023. @fig-cri illustrates a consistent rise in total crimes from 2021 to 2023, while the number of cleared cases remained relatively stable over the four-year period. Consequently, @tbl-cri reveals a steady decrease in the clearance rate, indicating a persistent decline in safety conditions in Toronto despite changes in the police budget.

It is important to note that the recorded total budget for 2023 may not accurately reflect the actual level of policing resources compared to previous years. Although 2024 data is not included in this paper, the recorded budget for that year is approximately 1.2 billion, similar to the 2023 budget. In contrast, earlier years had budgets exceeding 2 billion dollars. This discrepancy suggests a possible shift in measurement or recording methods in 2023, although @opendatatoronto does not indicate such a change. This limitation may affect the validity of the analysis presented in this paper.

last section for now: It is not possible to identify a significant relationship between yearly police budget and annual reported crimes from @bud-cri-relationship because while both yearly budgets and crime reports rose from 2020 to 2022, 2023 saw a sharp reduction in budget, making the trend appear negative. Moreover, due to the original datasets' constraints, only 4 data points were used for analysis, which is insufficient to establish correlations. Similarly, the relationship between police budget and the percentage of cleared crimes is also ambiguous. Once again, a negative relationship can be observed in @bud-clear-relationship from 2020 to 2022, but 2023 had the lowest budget as well as the lowest clearance percentage.

In summary, no conclusions can be made on the relationship between annual police budget and the level of safety within Toronto. As previously stated, this could be due to a change in measurement for the police budget dataset in 2023. However, the lack of a relationship is an outcome worthy of further investigation, because it hints that the amount of resources possessed by Toronto Police does not impact its ability to prevent crime. Therefore, it is imperative to determine why there is an increase in criminal activity despite government effort in recent years, whether it be socioeconomic factors that drives individuals toward crime, issues in lawmaking, or inefficiencies in policing.

Relationship Between Police Budget and Crime Rates

It is not possible to identify a significant relationship between the yearly police budget and annual reported crimes based on @bud-cri-relationship. From 2020 to 2022, both the police budget and crime reports increased, but in 2023, the budget sharply decreased, making the trend appear negative. Additionally, the original datasets provided only four data points for analysis, which is insufficient to establish meaningful correlations.

Similarly, the relationship between the police budget and the percentage of cleared crimes remains ambiguous. @bud-clear-relationship shows a negative relationship from 2020 to 2022, with 2023 recording both the lowest budget and the lowest clearance percentage.

In summary, no definitive conclusions can be drawn about the relationship between the annual police budget and the level of safety in Toronto. This uncertainty may stem from a possible change in the measurement of the police budget dataset in 2023. Nevertheless, the lack of a clear relationship warrants further investigation, suggesting that the resources allocated to the Toronto Police may not effectively impact crime prevention. It is crucial to determine why criminal activity has increased despite government efforts in recent years. Potential factors include socioeconomic influences driving individuals toward crime, issues in lawmaking, or inefficiencies within policing strategies
